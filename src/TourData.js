		info:
			'At Watamu beach the land sweats, the boats bob, the tide comes in and turtles hatch and make their laborious way down to the waves. The sea washes into Mida Creek lagoon, it creeps its way under the mangrove trees where the leaves fall like rain and turn into thick brown silt. Terrapins bask in the dampness on branches that dip below the water and huge crabs climb the trees or into traps that are set by local fisherman. No wind touches the inland creek. The humidity increases. Sweat beads the heads of the village ladies who carry babies on their backs in brightly coloured Kangas, and the men who labour over firewood with blunt pangas. '
